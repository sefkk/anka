      <p>
            As the IT Committee, we focus on diverse areas shaped by the needs of our community, members, and long-term goals. Here are 3 of the areas that the IT Community focuses on.<br><br>

            📍 Tech Innovation: We provide a supportive environment for students and graduates looking to launch their first projects in software, hardware, and digital solutions. With mentorship, connections to industry experts, and guidance on product development, we help turn innovative tech ideas into real-world solutions.<br><br>

            📍 Projects & Development: We collaborate on real world IT solutions by designing websites, building backends, developing apps, and creating tools that improve both our community and external partners. These projects allow members to sharpen their technical skills while delivering practical value.<br><br>

            📍 IT Community Services: Beyond development, we focus on areas like system optimization, infrastructure support, and cybersecurity, ensuring reliability, scalability, and security in everything we build. By working together, we foster an environment where members can learn, contribute, and innovate as part of a supportive tech community.<br><br>
