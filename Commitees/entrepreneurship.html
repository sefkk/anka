      <h3>Mission and Objectives</h3>
        <p>
            As the Entrepreneurship Committee, we operate in three main areasâ€”Start-up Hub, Workshops, and Career Daysâ€”to provide our members with a solid foundation in the business world.

            ðŸ”¹ Start-up Hub: We offer an incubation environment for students and graduates who wish to take their first steps into entrepreneurship. By providing mentorship, investor connections, and business development support, we help transform innovative ideas into reality.

            ðŸ”¹ Workshops: In our workshops with experienced entrepreneurs, investors, and industry professionals, we enhance our participants' skills in areas such as business model development, financial management, marketing strategies, and networking. Additionally, we support their growth in the professional world through sessions on CV writing, LinkedIn optimization, and interview techniques.

            ðŸ”¹ Career Days & Seminars: Through events that bring leading names from the entrepreneurship ecosystem together with students, we offer insights into the dynamics of the business world and help them expand their professional networks.

            At ANKAâ€™s Entrepreneurship Committee, we guide our members not only in nurturing their entrepreneurial spirit and building sustainable, successful business models, but also in advancing confidently in their professional career journeys.
        </p>

        <h3>Vision</h3>
