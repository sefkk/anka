    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h1>History and Future of ANKA</h1>
    <p>ANKA Association was founded in 2025 by a group of ambitious students in Amsterdam who recognized the need for a supportive and empowering network for Turkish and multicultural youth in the Netherlands. What started as a small initiative quickly evolved into a vibrant student community committed to mentorship, cultural connection, and professional growth. With each event and partnership, ANKA continues to expand its impact, bridging students with institutions, creating space for leadership, and fostering global-minded perspectives. Looking ahead, ANKA envisions becoming a leading voice for student empowerment across Europe, building long-term programs, expanding its network, and continuing to turn today’s challenges into tomorrow’s opportunities.</p>
